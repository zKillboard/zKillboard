## Notes
- zKillBot uses RedisQ to stream killmails from zKillBoard in near real-time. 
- If a name query matches multiple results, zKillBot will list the IDs so you can subscribe by ID or refine your search with a longer name.
- A channel may have multiple subscriptions.  
- Each killmail will only be posted once per channel, even if it matches more than one subscription.
- Subscriptions are per-channel, meaning different channels can track different entities.
- Each channel can have a different display configuration
- Killmails posted include links back to [zKillboard](https://zkillboard.com/) for full details.
- ISK values are adjusted to your guildId's locale setting.

## Upcoming Features
- Filter for losses or kills only (advanced filter?)
- Grouping iskValue, entityId, label together (advanced filter?)
- LOCALE implementation for language (ISK values already implemented)
- linking entities to their respective pages
- Fine-grained filters for precise control over subscriptions.  
- Subscribe to a system and receive killmails within a chosen jump range or light-year distance.
